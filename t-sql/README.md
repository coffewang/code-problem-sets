# T-SQL

Solve [classic Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)! 3x3x3 puzzle size: a 9x9 grid split into three 3x3 regions per row and column.

Extend it to 4x4x4 puzzle size: 16x16 split into four 4x4 regions

Bonus points! Generalize for a NxNxN puzzle size! Solution should be suitable for any whole square divided into subregions matching this pattern (25x25 split into 5x5s, 36x36 split into 6x6s etc.)
