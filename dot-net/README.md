## Background

A client who runs a Dog Sitting company has asked you to create an web-based application that connects to a SQL database of dogs and their owners to display several different views of their data. They have the following tables in the database:

* Owner
    - Name
    - Address
    - Email
    - Avatar image
* Breeds
    - Title
    - Wikipedia webpage
* Dog
    - Name of dog
    - Owner (many to many relationship to Owner)
    - Breed (many to many relationship to Breed)
    - Weight
    - Profile photo

## The task

1. Create a website landing page that lists all dogs
2. Create an additional page that lists all owners
3. Create a data entry webpage where the client can add a new owner and/or dog to the database via a series of form fields
4. Create a search function where the client can search by dog name, breed, or address and have a list of matches returned
5. Create a registration page where a new Owner can register themselves and their Dog(s)
